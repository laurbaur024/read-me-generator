# README Generator

## Activity

- I have created a README Generator using node.js and the dependency inquirer.
- Using the prompts, users can create a high-quality and professional looking README.

## User Instructions

- Open the terminal using the command 'node index.js'
- You will see a series of prompts in the terminal. Answer all the questions and a README file will be generated once you are done.

## Video

- Here is a link to the video of the working code.
